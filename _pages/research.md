Carrion beetles and their food
======

Carrion beetles (Coleoptera: Silphidae) feed and reproduce on vertebrate (especially mammal) carcasses. I take advantage of this behavior in my work in two ways.
1. I'm investigating whether food resource partitioning among carrion beetle species may enable their coexistence, and whether their food preferences may be limiting species elevational ranges.
2. I'm testing whether carrion beetles can be used as 'wildlife sensors' for mammal species. If we can detect mammal species using carrion beetle gut contents, longer-term, larger-scale studies can be conducted for the same field effort, as carrion beetles are less labor intensive to collect than mammals.

To answer these questions, I employ a marker gene sequencing methodology that enables the identification of mammalian DNA from carrion beetle gut contents.
