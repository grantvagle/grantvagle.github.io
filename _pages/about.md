I am passionate about the incredible diversity of life on Earth and love experiencing it in-person, whether that be out in nature, in the museum, or in the lab. I study large-scale biodiversity patterns, with an emphasis on the mammals and carrion beetles of the mountains of Colorado.

I'm a Ph.D. student in the [McCain Mountain Lab](https://spot.colorado.edu/~mccainc/ "McCain Lab") in the [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department](https://colorado.edu/ebio "CU - EBIO") at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I'm also a student in the [Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology](https://www.colorado.edu/certificate/iqbiology/ "IQ Biology") graduate program with the [BioFrontiers Institute](https://www.colorado.edu/biofrontiers/ "BioFrontiers").
